# Aggregate Design

Use this when choosing aggregate roots, entities, value objects, repositories, domain services, or consistency boundaries.

## Aggregate Roots

Create an aggregate root when a group of state and behavior must change consistently to protect business invariants.

Good signals:

- A command targets one clear consistency boundary.
- Rules require checking and changing several fields or child entities together.
- Other objects should refer to this concept by identity.

Avoid aggregates that only mirror database tables. If the use case is simple CRUD with no meaningful invariant, keep the model simpler.

Aggregate methods should be named as business actions, such as `submit`, `approve`, `reserve`, `expire`, `assign`, or `cancel`. Avoid setter-driven workflows when a named behavior can express the rule.

## Entities And Value Objects

Use an entity when identity matters across state changes.

Use a value object when equality is based on values and the object expresses a concept such as money, quantity, range, code, address, schedule, policy snapshot, or limit.

Put validation close to the value object when the rule defines the value itself. Put validation in the aggregate when the rule depends on lifecycle or aggregate state.

## Domain Services

Use a domain service only for domain decisions that do not naturally belong to one aggregate or value object.

Do not move application orchestration, transaction demarcation, security checks, logging, framework calls, or concrete persistence concerns into a domain service. Those belong in application services or adapters.

A domain decision may require an external business fact or capability. Record that need in the model
without selecting a Repository, Port, client, or adapter. Architecture guidance decides interface
placement and dependency direction after the architecture style and project constraints are known.
Prefer application coordination that supplies the required facts to domain behavior when that is
enough. Do not use domain services as a shortcut for moving use-case workflow, pagination,
reporting, wrappers, specifications, or other persistence-shaped queries into the domain model.

## Repositories

Repository is a DDD concept for aggregate lifecycle and command-side aggregate access. At the
modeling stage, record the aggregate lifecycle or access need without deciding whether a Repository
interface exists, which layer owns it, or whether an architecture maps it to a Port. When a
Repository is justified later, its methods should express domain intent rather than SQL condition
shape.

Queries for pages, reports, dashboards, projections, lookup context, or maintenance scans are usually read-side concerns, not aggregate repository responsibilities.

Prefer modifying one aggregate per transaction because aggregates are consistency boundaries. If a use case appears to require immediate consistency across multiple aggregates, first re-check the aggregate boundary; if the boundary is still valid, document the business reason and consistency tradeoff instead of hiding the exception.

## Aggregate Boundary Checks

- What invariant does this aggregate protect?
- Can the command complete by loading one aggregate?
- Is cross-aggregate consistency truly immediate, or can it be eventual?
- Is the aggregate too large because it is copying a screen or table shape?
- Does any child object need identity outside this aggregate?
- Are references to other aggregates by identity rather than object graph?
