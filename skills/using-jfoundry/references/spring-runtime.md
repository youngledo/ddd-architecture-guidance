# Spring Runtime Assembly

Use this reference only when a project explicitly selects Spring Framework, Spring Boot, or a Spring-specific jfoundry starter. Otherwise keep framework-neutral dependencies and assembly.

## Assembly Rules

- Put Spring Boot starters, the main class, global configuration, component scanning, and runtime wiring in the runtime assembly module/package, commonly `boot`.
- Keep domain code free of Spring. Keep application code free of HTTP, JPA, mapper, broker-record, and client-SDK types.
- Resolve the selected release's Spring dependency-management entry and runtime artifacts from its documentation or BOM. Do not copy coordinates from this skill.
- The business JPA or MyBatis-Plus persistence starter does not imply Outbox, Inbox, a broker, or a distributed lock. Add those only when the use case selects them.
- When JPA entities sit outside the package of the Spring Boot application class, register their package with `@EntityScan`. Entity registration is separate from schema management: keep Flyway or Liquibase as the application-owned schema authority and do not use Hibernate DDL creation for jfoundry tables.
- Treat Spring Boot AOT + GraalVM Native Image support as capability-specific. A successful base consumer does not certify a selected persistence store, broker, distributed lock, or JobRunr dispatching combination; verify the selected release's matching Native integration evidence before making that project claim.
- When an application serializes its own event payload types in a Spring Boot AOT + GraalVM Native Image, register the application-owned types for AOT binding as required by the selected Spring Boot version. Framework hints cannot infer arbitrary business payload types.

## Application Boundaries

Use a transaction boundary only for an application workflow that requires atomic changes. Keep it in application orchestration, whether the project uses a framework-neutral `TransactionRunner` or a selected Spring integration. Keep aggregate load and tracked modification in the same transaction.

For Spring MVC, HTTP response mapping remains a primary-adapter concern. Domain and application code select domain/application outcomes, not HTTP status codes. Use the selected release's web integration only when the project chooses its problem-response mapping.

Outbox, Inbox, broker, lock, and JobRunr dispatch decisions remain optional capabilities. Read their specialized references before selecting a starter. For non-Spring runtimes, do not reuse Spring Boot starters.

Read `references/upstream-documentation.md` for exact auto-configuration conditions, transaction annotations, properties, proxy constraints, and exception mappings.
